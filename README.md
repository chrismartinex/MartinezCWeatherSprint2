# MartinezCWeatherSprint4
In this assignment we were asked to create a 5 day weather forecast, this also included the availability to add favorite cities, 
be able to delete favortie cities. 
The way in which my app is working, is that you can add a zip code or city, and you will be able to recieve live data. 
The city that your calling should appear at the botton of the forecast.
